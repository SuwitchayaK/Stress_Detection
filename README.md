# Aware of Your Stress: A Stress Detection Using Wearable Watch

This project focuses on predicting stress levels using physiological data collected from a wearable watch. The goal is to assess the predictive accuracy of machine learning models and evaluate whether the device is suitable for stress detection in patients.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset: The raw data of participants ID11 to ID35 (25 participants). The data and the detailed descriptions can be found at the following link: https://github.com/italha-d/Stress-Predict-Dataset.git, and the processed data is in 'StressDetection.csv' file. The features in this project include heart rate (HR), blood volume pressure (BVP), accelerometer (ACC), skin conductance (EDA), inter-beat interval (IBI), and skin temperature (TEMP).



 
**Libraries used in the project:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn
